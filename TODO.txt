Injectable application config
Figure out how to use Argonautica's Hasher/Verifier as Actix Data params
    Data only impls Deref, not DerefMut unfortunately
    We can't wrap in a Cell because Hasher/Verifier isn't Copy either
User sessions
    Are we handling this in a sane way??
    Differentiate between no-session and an invalid session
PMs
    I don't like the fact that you can store "private" messages in the DB
    I wonder if there is a way to do some sort of E2E encryption
        Maybe give users the option to 'encrypt' conversations that get unlocked with a read-time password
Caching
Where to put "view" structs
Logging
Error handling
Server-Sent Events
    Real-time updates for posting
Maybe use handlers?
Get rid of all these clone/to_owned/to_string calls
    I hate this so much
