Injectable application config
Figure out how to use Argonautica's Hasher/Verifier as Actix Data params
    Data only impls Deref, not DerefMut unfortunately
    We can't wrap in a Cell because Hasher/Verifier isn't Copy either
User sessions
    Are we handling this in a sane way??
    Differentiate between no-session and an invalid session
Caching
Where to put "view" structs
Separate DB logic from controller
Logging
Error handling
Server-Sent Events
    Real-time updates for posting
Maybe use handlers?
